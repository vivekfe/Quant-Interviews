Here are scripts and formats for phone and face to face interviews along with general guidance

 ## Golden Rules

* The interview is a conversation not an interrogation. The candidate MUST also want to work with us at the end of the process, otherwise the process has failed.

* Use the interview to become sure if you offer - It is better to miss a potentially good candidate than accidentally let a bad one in.

##  Phone

A phone interview should last around 30 minutes. It should be able to be done by one team member. A second team member may wish to join for additional interview experience.

## Format

> Hi
> Is this `<Candidate name>`
> My name is `<Your name>`, I'm calling from HSBC Krakow's Product Control Team, were you expecting this call?

This is important to establish you're speaking to the correct person, at the correct time. If not, just appologise, end the call and go and address the issue.

> This is going to be a short 30 minute java technical interview, is this ok?


Again good to establish that the candidate is expecting this format

 After this point start going through the questions you have prepared.

After asking all the questions

> That's all the questions I have. Do you have any questions for me?


Expect to answer

    1. Details about the role
    2. Details about the team
    3. Details about the technology
    4. Details about the hiring process

Answers should be fairly short and high level at this stage, but we need to allow time for the candidate to ask appropriate questions.

To end the interview.

> Thank you very much for your time, feedback will be given via your agency.

## Notes

1. Often Candidates may not be in an ideal place for a phone call, do ask them to repeat themselves/speak up. If its impossible to understand request to rearrange to a better time

2.  It can become obvious quickly that a candidate is not appropriate for the role. Do not just cut the interview short, the candidate may surprise you later and we owe the candidate a full phone interview. Carry on as you would with any other interview.

3.  Phone interview is a rough filter, if you think a candidate is worthwhile but have reservations its ok to put through to face to face but to make sure any perceived weaknesses are addressed at the face to face

## Face-to-face

This should be 1-2 hours long. A candidate should meet multiple members of the team.

Ideally a room will be allocated for the full duration of the interview.


## Format

1.  Meet the Candidate at the appropriate reception (in 8CS, either on the ground floor or at one of the transfer floors)
2.  Escort the Candidate to the meeting room
3.  Introduce all members of the interview panel
4.  Ensure the Candidate is comfortable, offer them water or a drink.
5.  Thank the Candidate for coming in
6.  Ask what the Candidate knows about the role
7.  Explain
    1.  Who we are
    2.  What the team does
    3.  What the project does
    4.  What the role does
8.  Explain the interview format
    1.  Give an indication of the order of the questions and interviewers
    2.  Give an expectation of total time
9.  Run through the interview as prepared
10.  Allow the Candidate to ask any questions they may have
11.  Thank the Candidate again for their time, explain feedback will be given via agency
12.  Escort the Candidate out to the main reception
